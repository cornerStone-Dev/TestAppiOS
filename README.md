Testing out GitHub access through Xcode

Current work flow for using GitHub with Xcode in order to get all the benefits of both.

1. Clone the project
-- now for adding changes
2. Branch from master
   a. If within Xcode you then to "push" up to GitHub to create the branch

3. Make change(s) and commit(s) to your branch. You can "push" your branch up to GitHub to save progress.

4. When finished with changes within that branch do a "Pull Request" from within GitHub so it can be merged into master branch.
5. After "pull request" is completed the branch should be deleted and any new changes should go into a new branch.
